# Deepfake Detection System

This project uses AI and deep learning to detect deepfake videos and images. The system analyzes facial features and inconsistencies in media to classify it as either real or altered.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection-system.git
   cd deepfake-detection-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model and place it inside the `model/` directory.

4. Run the script:
   ```
   python src/deepfake_detection.py
   ```

## Usage:
The script will process a video or image and classify it as "Real" or "Deepfake."
